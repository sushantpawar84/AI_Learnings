Concepts of LLM and AI: 
NLP -> ML -> LLM -> Gen AI


Pre Training and Fine Tunning. 
First stage of LLM is called Pretraining. Ex. GPT3 model is a pretrained model which is capable of text completion
After pretraining, we can further train LLM which is called FINETUNNING. 
FINETUNNING are of 2 categories:
Intruction Finetunning
Finetunning for Classification Tasks
Finetunning happens on labelled data. Pre Training happens on raw data.
