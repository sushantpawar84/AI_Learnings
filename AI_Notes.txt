Concepts of LLM and AI: 
NLP -> ML -> LLM -> Gen AI

Some Python framework and libraries:
1. Torch framework
2. Transformers lib
3. Datasets lib
4. Accelerate lib
5. peft - Parameter-Efficient-Fine-Tunning Lib

Pre Training and Fine Tunning. 
First stage of LLM is called Pretraining. Ex. GPT3 model is a pretrained model which is capable of text completion
After pretraining, we can further train LLM which is called FINETUNNING. 
FINETUNNING are of 2 categories:
Intruction Finetunning
Finetunning for Classification Tasks
Finetunning happens on labelled data. Pre Training happens on raw data. 

Transformers:

Transformer Achitechture = Deep neural network architecture introduced in 2017
